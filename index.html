    <p>Fans eagerly awaiting the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will have to wait a little longer. Developer Team Cherry announced today that the game’s launch has been delayed due to the discovery of a critical last-minute bug.</p>

    <p>“We want Silksong to be as polished and enjoyable as possible,” Team Cherry wrote in a statement. “Unfortunately, a complex issue surfaced during final testing that affects gameplay stability. We need additional time to address this before release.”</p>

    <p>This marks yet another delay in the long-anticipated follow-up to <em>Hollow Knight</em>. While Team Cherry has not provided a new release date, they assured fans that development is progressing steadily and that the delay is necessary to uphold the game’s quality standards.</p>

    <p>Despite the setback, excitement remains high for <em>Silksong</em>, which promises an expansive new world, hundreds of enemies, and Hornet’s fast-paced acrobatics. For now, fans will have to keep waiting for the highly anticipated adventure.</p>
